# LangChain for LLM Application Development

A comprehensive course on building robust LLM applications using the LangChain framework and LangGraph extension.

## Course Overview

Gained essential skills in expanding the use cases and capabilities of language models in application development. This course covered both foundational LangChain concepts and advanced agent development with LangGraph, taught by LangChain creator Harrison Chase and Andrew Ng.

## Core Learning Modules

### LangChain Fundamentals
1. **Models, Prompts and Parsers**
   - Calling LLMs effectively
   - Crafting and managing prompts
   - Parsing and processing responses

2. **Memory Systems for LLMs**
   - Conversation storage and management
   - Context space optimization
   - Memory types and implementations

3. **Chains**
   - Creating sequences of operations
   - Building complex workflows
   - Chaining multiple LLM calls

4. **Question Answering over Documents**
   - Apply LLMs to proprietary data
   - Custom use case implementations
   - Document processing and retrieval

5. **Agents**
   - LLM as reasoning agents
   - Emerging agent development patterns
   - Agent decision-making frameworks

### Advanced LangGraph Development

#### Agent Architecture
- **From Scratch Implementation**: Build agents using Python and LLMs to understand core mechanics
- **LangGraph Migration**: Rebuild agents using LangGraph components for enhanced control
- **Task Division**: Learn optimal separation between LLM reasoning and surrounding code logic

#### Advanced Features
1. **Agentic Search**
   - Multiple answer retrieval in agent-friendly formats
   - Enhanced built-in knowledge integration
   - Superior data provision for improved agent output

2. **State Management & Persistence**
   - Cross-thread state management
   - Conversation switching capabilities
   - Previous state reloading functionality

3. **Human-in-the-Loop Integration**
   - Interactive agent systems
   - Human oversight and intervention
   - Collaborative AI workflows
